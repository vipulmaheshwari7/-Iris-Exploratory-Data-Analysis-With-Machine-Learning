Here I am sharing the link of the wikipedia page of this dataset to get little more information about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
This dataset is widely used for machine learning practices. I am here initially doing an exploratory analysis of the datato gain some insights.
Install:
I am using Python 3.6.1 for this analysis. You need to install the folowing Python libraries.

NumPy (for documentation:http://www.numpy.org/)
Pandas (for documentation:http://pandas.pydata.org/)
Matplotlib (for documentation: https://matplotlib.org/)
Seaborn (for documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
I have used Jupyter Notebook for the data exploration.

Data:
You can see the data in 'Iris.csv' file.

Code:
The complete code is in the 'iris eda with ml python notebook.ipynb' file.
